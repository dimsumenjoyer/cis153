# Chapter 11, Problem 1:

This function prompts the user for a regular expression as an input then searches the file access_log.txt for any matches.
I used a try-catch to accord for any potential errors. It tracks the amount of matches there are that file.
While debugging, I made to change the .findall() method to .search().

# Chapter 11 Problem 2:

This function sesarches for all of the numbers at the end of each line, adds them together, and computes their averages.
