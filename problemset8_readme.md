I, more or less, copied and pasted the code from the textbook and edited it so it would a user could input any url as instructed.
I used character_count in the while loop to keep track of the amount of characters that the URL spits back into the python program,
but I'm not sure if it's actually working properly.

I tried to use Overleaf (a LaTex editor) and a Scienific American article as examples, but I had issues with those.
However, www.example.com works fine.

I made an account for Spotify's API, but I haven't done anything with it.
There are different options for Spotify's APIs. If you want to be able to play music, you need a spotify subscription.
However, it seems like receiving data about artists on Spotify is free.
