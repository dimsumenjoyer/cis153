I had a lot of issues with this problem set because I spent a lot of time and energy focusing on project 2.

However, most of this problem set is string parsing and then storing them in dictionaries and lists.
I used the .items() on my dictionaries a lot, which puts elements in the dictionary in a list. 
Then you can use list[number] to isolate those elements.
However, I had issues with finding the time in the last problem because my lines varied in length.
The time would be the 5th spot in the list, but not all lists have the same length. 
I don't know how to account for that, and I like to figure things out myself so I unfortunately have not finished this problem set
to a reasonable standard.

Professor Penta also helped me with dictionaries, for instance:
if email not in email_directionary:
    email_directionary[email] = 1
I've also used a dictionary comprehension on 79.

(Side note, I didn't know that the .get method could omit the parenthesis and still work.)
