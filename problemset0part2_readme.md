This is problem set 0 - part 2.
Professor Penta only instructed us to type any usable code as two seperate files.
Instead of typing something simple such as: print("Hello world!"),
I copied and pasted some old code from an assignment I did in
introduction to computer science which is just a weekly wage calculator.
It uses a function and asks you to input your hours and wages and stores them as floats.
If your hours are under 40, then you have part time pay.
If your hours are 40 hours, then you're have full time pay.
If your hours are over 40 hours, then you have over-time pay.
I set overtime pay at 1.5x the regular pay, but this could differ depending on jobs.
